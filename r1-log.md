# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Elisheba

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 14, Sunday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1

I learned more about linked list algorithms and got started on learning about tree algorithms. I followed a person working through problems involving the algorithms to get some momentum back after hitting a wall yesterday.

### R1D2

I learned about solving an algorithm breadth first and depth first. Learned about tree algorithms such as Binary Search Trees. Went through event algorithms using jQuery and wrapped up learning sorting algorithms.
