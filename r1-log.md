The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 14, Sunday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1

I learned more about linked list algorithms and got started on learning about tree algorithms. I followed a person working through problems involving the algorithms to get some momentum back after hitting a wall yesterday.

### R1D2

I learned about solving an algorithm breadth first and depth first. Learned about tree algorithms such as Binary Search Trees. Went through event algorithms using jQuery and wrapped up learning sorting algorithms.

## R1D3

I started the JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts course. Went over scope, exe context, and more. 1h

## R1D4

I continued the JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts course and learned about types, operators, objects and functions in depth. 3h

## R1D5

Worked on a little of a Charter for Compassion PR and learned a little about Reference by value in JavaScript. 1h

Continued to learn more about weird JavaScript including this , arrays and syntax parsers. Got bored and decided to pick up React and Ruby on Rails project Invoice Pro. 2h

##R1D7

Did 30 min of JavaScript Weirdness course and an hour and a half planning and coding my Invoice Pro application.

##R1D8

Spent all day on JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts and I've got to say I'm starting to understand. Building my first framework helped me to learn the possibilities and also learn what people mean by reading the source code and understanding that you should learn vanilla JavaScript before or while learning a framework. Things I thought where pure React are really just JavaScript. 8h

##R1D9

Finished JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts, but not done playing with the framework I created through the course. Want to play with it and make it mine. Rest of days will involve creating projects, code challenges and contributing to open source. 3h

##R1D10

Extended the framework I created in the JavaScript course by adding Logout functionality and learned a little about how to work with jQuery.2h

##R1D11

Ran out of time today, but I did move the framework out of the actual application that I was creating. I might try to rename it to something more fitting. 45m

##R1D12

I added more functionality to my Joke Generator app. Implemented Bootstrap and looked under the hood of the framework. I created a new library to hold the translations for the body of the app. Got to work a lot more with jQuery 6h

##R1D13

Decided to remove the placeholder text information in the app. Added the joke output element to joke.js and the page. Worked more with jQuery, HTML, and CSS. 4h

##R1D14 - R1D18

Learned about AJAX ,Web Services and the basics of web development. 5h

##R1D19

Added the joke output to my joke app. Pushed through a problem where I needed to learn how to take the value of an element and concat the values together to display the resulting joke. 1h

##R1D20

Added documentation to my current projects, and updated my portfolio with my new Joke Compiler app. 1h

##R1D21

Added some stying to my Joke Compiler app, and moved joke.js library to a separate repo. Also, worked a little on my portfolio. 1h
