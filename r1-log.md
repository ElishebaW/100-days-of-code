# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Elisheba

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 14, Sunday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1

I learned more about linked list algorithms and got started on learning about tree algorithms. I followed a person working through problems involving the algorithms to get some momentum back after hitting a wall yesterday.

### R1D2

I learned about solving an algorithm breadth first and depth first. Learned about tree algorithms such as Binary Search Trees. Went through event algorithms using jQuery and wrapped up learning sorting algorithms.

## R1D3

I started the JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts course. Went over scope, exe context, and more. 1h

## R1D4

I continued the JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts course and learned about types, operators, objects and functions in depth. 3h

## R1D5

Worked on a little of a Charter for Compassion PR and learned a little about Reference by value in JavaScript. 1h

## R1D6

Continued to learn more about weird JavaScript including this , arrays and syntax parsers. Got bored and decided to pick up React and Ruby on Rails project Invoice Pro. 2h

##R1D7

Did 30 min of JavaScript Weirdness course and an hour and a half planning and coding my Invoice Pro application.

##R1D8

Spent all day on JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts and I've got to say I'm starting to understand. Building my first framework helped me to learn the possibilities and also learn what people mean by reading the source code and understanding that you should learn vanilla JavaScript before or while learning a framework. Things I thought where pure React are really just JavaScript. 8h
